# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game (Java)

## 📌 Project Description

This is a **console-based Rock Paper Scissors game** developed using **core Java**.
The game allows the user to play against the computer, where the computer randomly selects its move and the result is displayed based on standard Rock–Paper–Scissors rules.

The project is designed for **beginners** to practice Java fundamentals while building a fun and interactive mini game.

## ⚙️ Features

* User vs Computer gameplay
* Random computer move generation
* Clear win, lose, and tie results
* Continuous gameplay until exit
* Simple and interactive console interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Java
* Scanner class (user input)
* Random class (computer choice generation)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* Conditional statements (`if-else`)
* Loops
* Methods and return values
* String comparison
* Arrays
* Random number generation

---

## ▶️ How the Game Works

1. The user chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer randomly selects one option.
3. Both choices are compared using game rules.
4. The program displays whether the user **wins**, **loses**, or the match is a **tie**.
5. The game continues until the user decides to exit.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `Main` class contains the game loop and user interaction.
* A separate method is used to compare user and computer choices and return the result.

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand how to:

* Build a loop-based interactive program
* Separate logic using methods
* Use arrays and randomness in real-world scenarios
* Write clean and readable Java code

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

* Add score tracking
* Create a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Add sound or animations
* Extend the game with more options

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This Rock Paper Scissors game is a great beginner-level Java project that demonstrates logical thinking and core programming concepts in a fun and engaging way.
